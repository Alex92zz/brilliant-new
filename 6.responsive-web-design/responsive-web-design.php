                <p class="paragraph-space module">It’s not just about mobile search ranking. Responsive website design is vital in presenting a consistent brand image across all devices. Web presence, after all, means nothing if the said presence doesn’t provide positive experiences for the target audience.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-space module">Responsive web design enables your website layout to adapt to even the largest or smallest screens. This adaptive technology is forward-compatible, adjusting even to newer devices and higher resolutions.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-space module">Mobile-friendliness is an important design consideration that often gets overlooked or glossed-over during website creation or redesign. It’s a requirement for some, for others just another feature in the design package. Either way, responsive website design has a huge impact on the overall performance of not only your website but also your marketing strategies.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-space module">SEO has many facets. It’s not as simple as researching high-value keywords. </p>
                <p class="paragraph-space module">On-page SEO is an umbrella term covering all on-page ranking factors that determine the ranking performance of a webpage for a specific keyword – different pages target different keywords. On-page SEO has one key difference from off-page SEO: you have direct control over its performance. Off-page or off-site mainly involves link building and other tactics that don’t involve optimization within the website itself.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-space module">Google has indicated site speed is one of the signals used by its algorithm to rank pages. A slow page speed will not only affect your indexation on search engines but will also deter would be clients with low internet speed from your website and create a bad user experience.</p>
